# USAF-OpenAir

This web application will automate the deconfliction of scheduled flights and provide easy access to information about the scheduling for the routes in that airspace. Instead of a pilot calling up an airspace scheduler and having them manually lookup and schedule your flight in a logbook, Open Air will provide a means of automated and efficient route scheduling while ensuring airplanes will have sufficient space between each other to ensure pilot safety. It will also increase the visibility of currently scheduled flights across different airspaces to pilots and their operations supervisors. Also, the app will remove the outdated 15 minute rule and allow the pilots to have more options in scheduling their MTRs. This will allow the pilots to fly more often and lead to shorter training periods before pilots are combat mission ready. Route entry points, exit points and the aircraft speed will be used to efficiently optimize the scheduling of every MTR. In addition, if conflicts arise, the app will give suggestions for possible alternative scheduling. For flights that have intersecting routes, Open Air will ensure no other flights are scheduled that would cause a conflict at the time of the plane crossing this intersection point. Overall, Open Air will provide a faster and more responsive flow of communication and increase the throughput of airspace usage.
